# Binary Patch Notes

This document lists the applied binary patches for known issues discovered during fuzzing and syscall analysis.

---

## 1. `vuln_buffer_overflow.c` (Buffer Overflow Patch)
**Issue:** Unbounded `strcpy` call
**Patch:** Replaced with `strncpy(buffer, input, sizeof(buffer) - 1);`

---

## 2. `syscall_test_linux.c` (Hardening)
**Issue:** Raw syscall usage
**Patch:** Wrapped syscall call in a safety check to validate syscall number range.

---

## 3. Legacy FTP Server Binary (simulated)
**Issue:** Directory traversal vulnerability via `..//..`
**Patch:** Input sanitization applied; directory paths normalized before execution.

---

## 4. Sample PE file
**Issue:** Uninitialized stack variable causing undefined behavior.
**Patch:** All local variables zeroed at declaration.

---

## 5. Loader stub
**Issue:** RWX memory mapping enabled for shellcode execution.
**Patch:** Recompiled with `-Wl,-z,noexecstack -fstack-protector-strong`.

---

These patches were applied and binaries recompiled for safety verification.
